# Blogger

This is my first ever Rails application—I made it by following the [Blogger](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) tutorial at Jumpstart Lab.

## Getting started

If you want to try the project yourself, navigate to [the tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) and follow the instructions.

You also view my own version of the app online—it is hosted on heroku [here](lit-garden-31735.herokuapp.com). 

## Final Notes

I created this app while following [the Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com), a free web development curriculum.
